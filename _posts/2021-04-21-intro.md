<p>
I am currently available to consult on workforce and evaluation projects for and across the public, private, and government sectors.
<br><br>
Promoting the general betterment of society is my primary career goal.
<br><br>
My current mission is to use my 25 years of training and experience with skills in consulting, evaluation, and workforce analytics to assist with the targeted implementation of infrastructure projects that promote social cohesion, which is arguably much needed at present and essential for future climate change mitigation strategies.
