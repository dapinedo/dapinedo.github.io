Notes about Qualifications:
- I have used several change management tools over the years, from the Agile side (SCRUM) to the compliance side (ITIL) of management.

- My technical skills span from using the lowest levels of programming and prototyping (e.g. C, C++, R) to analytics products that aid in strategic projects and operations (e.g. OrgVue, Tableau, PowerBI, Gartner Talent Neuron, Polinode, Excel, Minitab). I have assisted several vendors over the years with bug reports, coding errors, and software testing.
