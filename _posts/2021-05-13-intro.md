I am currently available for senior analyst, consultant, manager roles in workforce analytics, organization transformation, and organization design.

I am also available to consult related to methods and advanced statistics on program evaluation projects for and across the public, private, and government sectors.

My current mission is to use skills in consulting, evaluation, and workforce analytics to assist with the targeted implementation of infrastructure projects that promote social cohesion.

Primary Skills:
- statistics (including machine learning)
- social science research methods
- management consulting.

Other Qualifications:
- I have used several change management tools over the years, from the Agile side (SCRUM) to the compliance side (ITIL) of management. I have a Six Sigma Black Belt certificate from Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam.
- I have completed all preparation for PMP project management certification.
- My technical skills span from using the lowest levels of programming and prototyping (e.g. C, C++, R) to analytics products that aid in workforce projects and operations (e.g. OrgVue, Tableau, PowerBI, Gartner Talent Neuron, Polinode). I have assisted several vendors over the years with bug reports, coding errors, and software testing.
