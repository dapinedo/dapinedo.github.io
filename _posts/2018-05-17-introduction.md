Daniel is an HR Strategist and Researcher. He is passionate about creating inclusive workplaces that are harmonious (high psychological safety), balanced (high equity), and innovative (creatively successful) with higher levels of overall firm absorptive capacity (research & development and acquisitions of intellectual capital). You may find Daniel wandering around identifying plants and fungi with his son, having art and cooking parties with his partner Carolyn, or staring out the window at nothing in particular.
