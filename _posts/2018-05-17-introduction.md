Daniel is a first-year student in the Organizational Behavior & Evaluation program at Claremont Graduate University. He is passionate about STEM talent management, people analytics, strategy, diversity & inclusion, wellness initiatives, and governmental / private sector initiatives that engage climate change and gender equality.

He is an experienced undergraduate, upper-division lecturer in quantitative & qualitative research methods in the social sciences. Daniel has taught and/or developed coursework in social, industrial/organizational, and positive psychology. He has over a decade of experience in the fields of mindfulness, addictions recovery, and positive and clinical psychology. Daniel has recently consulted on organizational development matters with local law enforcement, internet backbone companies, and university electrophysiology labs.

During his downtime, you will find Daniel at the Crossfit box wrestling with gravity, learning tango and bachata, or trying out a new healthy high-protein meal-plan recipe. However, his all-time favorite pastimes are teaching his 7-year-old son to swim, cook, and rake leaves.
