My life vision and mission is to study and understand mental health trends locally and worldwide. I hope to use this information to nurture social infrastructure that in turn enable social cohesion.
<br><br>
I am a data scientist and statistician. I am also a subject matter expert in social science research, mental health science, and organizational theory. At the moment I am training expertise in urban planning and psychiatric epidemiology. I have over 25 years of work experience in the public, private, military, and civic sectors.
