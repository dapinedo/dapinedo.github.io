Experiencing joy and laughter with others are essential elements in my life. Moreover, I believe they are key elements for social cohesion in general. My life vision and mission is to study, understand, and nurture those things that enable social bonds in our common spaces.
<br><br>
My primary skillset is organizational strategy which includes analytics, design, and planning. I have extensive experience in the public, private, and civic sectors.
