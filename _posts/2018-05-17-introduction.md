Daniel is an HR Strategist with a specialized background in research methods, inclusion, innovation, and decision-making. He is fascinated by deep learning, network theory, directed evolution, space, climate change mitigation, and all things related to biotechnology. You may find Daniel wandering around identifying plants and fungi with his son, having art parties with his partner Carolyn, or staring out the window at nothing in particular.
