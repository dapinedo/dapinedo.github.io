I am currently available for roles in workforce analytics and organizational transformation.

I am also available to consult related to methods and advanced statistics on program evaluation projects for and across the public, private, and government sectors.

My current mission is to use skills in consulting, evaluation, and workforce analytics to assist with the targeted implementation of infrastructure projects that promote social cohesion.

- My technical skills span from using the lowest levels of programming and prototyping (e.g. C, C++, R) to analytics products that aid in workforce projects and operations (e.g. OrgVue, Tableau, Gartner Talent Neuron, Polinode). I have assisted several vendors over the years with bug reports, coding errors, and software testing.
- I have used several change management tools over the years, from the software development side (SCRUM) to the compliance side (ITIL) of management.
- I know PowerPoint inside and out for executive-level presentation, although a good whiteboard works wonders especially with a technical crowd.
