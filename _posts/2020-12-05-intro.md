<p>
My life purpose is to help improve the human condition as much as possible using the scientific skillsets of statistics, analysis, and synthesis.
<br><br>
My current mission is to study mental health trends locally and worldwide. My vision is that in understanding and monitoring these trends we may in turn shape policies that lead to targeted and immediately impactful implementation of social infrastructure. This infrastructure may in turn promote social cohesion and resilience that is much needed at present and in future climate change mitigation strategies.
<br><br>
I am a data scientist, statistician, and evaluator. I have subject matter expertise in social science research methods, clinical psychology, mental health science, and organizational behavior. I am currently training expertise in urban planning and psychiatric epidemiology. I have over 25 years of work experience in the public, private, military, and civic sectors.
