<p>
My life mission is to study mental health trends locally and worldwide. My vision is to understand these trends in order to shape policy that leads to relevant implementation of social infrastructure. This infrastructure may in turn promote social cohesion and resilience that is much needed now and in the future.

I am a data scientist, statistician, and evaluator. I have subject matter expertise in social science research methods, clinical psychology, mental health science, and organizational behavior. I am currently training expertise in urban planning and psychiatric epidemiology. I have over 25 years of work experience in the public, private, military, and civic sectors.
